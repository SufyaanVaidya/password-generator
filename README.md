## Installation

1. i created a repository to store and add starter code.
2. After the repo was created i copied over the given starter to my own repository via git bash.
3. With the starter files added i pushed them to the repo.
4. Once on the repo i began editing the Javascript file.
5. Once the structure was made i added titles, links, headers, and p tags to create its base.
6. When the base was there i gave each element that needed to be targeted a class or an id.
7. On css with the tags and their classes/id's i began to target and style each tag.
8. After the tags were styled i made everything line up in the correct order i wanted.
9. When in order i made the nav links travel through the page.
10. Once the pages were finished i added a self picture and moved it to line up with the center.
