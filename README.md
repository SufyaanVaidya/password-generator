## Installation

1. i created a repository to store and add starter code.
2. After the repo was created i copied over the given starter to my own repository via git bash.
3. With the starter files added i pushed them to the repo.
4. Once on the repo i began editing the Javascript file.
5. With the starter code i was given the event listener and the code for it to appear on the page but
    will not generate or appear any prompts so first i added prompts asking how and what the password
    will consist of, i did this by adding propt fuctions and alerts to the js file.
6. I also added alerts for if the password doesnt meet the criteria that it will loop
    until it is met.
7. Once or if all cirteria are met the password will be generated from the selected options,
    and appear in the text area in the center of the page.

## Usage 

- Clicking the "generate password" button will begin the criteria prompts

- inputting the wrong character amount or not using any of the options to pick what the password consists of,
    you will be repeatedly asked to follow the requirements for the password.

- When all the prompts are answered you will receive a generated password inside the text area that you
    may copy and use, or generate a new password by folowing the steps.
